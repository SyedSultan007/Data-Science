        "\n",
        "Project for Predicting Price Range of Mobiles\n",
        "\n",
        "Introduction\n",
        "This project intends to predict the price range of mobiles based on the classification model. The data set contains 2000 mobile records with 21 attributes like battery power, RAM, screen dimension, and the mobile supports features or not like 3G, 4G, or dual SIM. The `price_range` target variable is split into four categories: 0 (low), 1 (medium), 2 (high), and 3 (very high). Three machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are applied to train and test the classification model.\n",
        "    \n",
        "#### Dataset Description\n",
        "The dataset encompasses many of the factors that define mobile prices, for example:\n",
        "- **Battery Power**: The amount of power in the battery in mAh.\n",
        "- **RAM**: Amount of Random Access Memory.\n",
        "- **Pixel Height and Width**: Resolution parameters.\n",
        "- **Clock Speed**: CPU in GHz.\n",
        "- **Mobile Weight**: Physical weight of the mobile.\n",
        "- **Cores**: CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "All of these features, except `price_range`, are either numeric or binary (whether a feature is available).There's no missing data, which helps simplify preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Method\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pre-processing**\n",
        "   Since the data is all numeric, there is no encoding to be made.\n",
        "- The dataset is divided into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing) to be used in the evaluation of the model.\n",
        "-Features will be standardized where appropriate-for instance, `battery_power` and `ram-to improve performance, especially for models such as Logistic Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Implementation:**\n",
        "Logistic Regression: This linear model assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the class. It is quite easy to interpret and works pretty well for classification tasks\n",
        "Decision Tree: A non-linear, tree-based model that splits the data based on feature values. Since it is completely based on the features of the data, it is easily interpretable and can also represent interactions between features.\n",
        "- **Random Forest**: It is an ensemble approach that combines many Decision Trees and primarily focuses on increasing accuracy while reducing overfitting. This approach is applicable to big datasets with very strong correlated features.\n",
        "3. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: Percentage of instances correctly classified.\n",
        "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Used to measure the trade-off between precision and recall for each of the two models.\n",
        "- **Confusion Matrix**: Helps understand what the model thinks for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Results and Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Logistic Regression**: Simple, yet gave fairly decent accuracy on this data set. Is certainly limited on non-linear relationships between features.\n",
        "Decision Tree: Does quite well, and provides good insights into which features it chooses as important for predicting a price range, for example RAM, battery power, but it can clearly cause overfitting on the training data.\n",
        "- **Random Forest**: Chanced to be performing better than both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models. But it had produced an efficient reduction of overfitting through the use of an average for multiple trees, thus providing a good accuracy rate on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        " There was a comparison between these models based on their precision plus other evaluation criteria. Although Random Forest tends to perform better in terms of accuracy and robustness, Logistic Regression had provided a simpler solution with moderate performance in fewer steps in time.\n",
        "\n",
        " #### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "It will thus be demonstrated to implement various classification models in predicting the mobile price range using a relevant set of features. Of all the models, Random Forest was the one that best covered the characteristics because it addresses complex nonlinear relationships and is immune to overfitting. Although less accurate, Logistic Regression provided an easier alternative. Decision Trees are more interpretable in that they could explain why an attribute was ranked higher than another one but have a tendency to overfit unless pruned or controlled using hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even at that, future work may tune the hyperparameter to enhance this further through techniques like GridSearchCV. Feature engineering along the lines of combining or generating new features may unmask even stronger predictors of mobile price range."

        "### Data Wrangling Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Checked for Missing Values**:\n",
        "   - **No missing values** were found in the dataset, so no imputation or removal of rows/columns was necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dropped Unnecessary Columns**:\n",
        "   - While no specific columns were dropped in this case, I left the placeholder for dropping redundant columns based on domain knowledge, if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Categorical Variable Handling**:\n",
        "   - The dataset contains several binary categorical variables (`blue`, `dual_sim`, `four_g`, `three_g`, `touch_screen`, `wifi`). These were already in binary numeric form (`0` or `1`), so no further encoding was needed.\n",
        "   - If non-binary categorical variables existed, `pd.get_dummies()` would be used to convert them into numerical form, but it wasn't necessary here.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
        "   - **Numerical variables** (such as `battery_power`, `clock_speed`, `ram`, etc.) were scaled using `StandardScaler`. This ensures that all features are on the same scale, which is especially important for machine learning algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude (e.g., gradient-based models).\n",
        "   - Binary variables (e.g., `four_g`, `blue`, etc.) were not scaled as their values are already standardized (0 or 1).\n",
        "   - **Target variable `price_range`** was excluded from scaling since it is categorical.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Splitting**:\n",
        "   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using `train_test_split`. This ensures a fair evaluation of machine learning models by keeping the test data unseen during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **No Missing Data**:\n",
        "   - All columns had complete data without any missing values, making the dataset clean and straightforward to work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Binary Features**:\n",
        "   - Several features are binary, such as whether the phone has Bluetooth (`blue`), dual SIM functionality (`dual_sim`), 4G (`four_g`), 3G (`three_g`), and touchscreen capability (`touch_screen`).\n",
        "   - These binary features are useful for classification tasks, as they provide direct information about the presence or absence of certain functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Numerical Features**:\n",
        "   - Important features include `battery_power`, `clock_speed`, `ram`, `int_memory`, and camera specifications (`fc` and `pc`), which are typical characteristics affecting the price and performance of mobile phones.\n",
        "   - The `ram` feature, in particular, could be a strong predictor of the target variable `price_range`, as higher RAM typically corresponds to higher prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Potential Feature Correlations**:\n",
        "   - Features such as `px_height` (pixel height) and `px_width` (pixel width) may be correlated with each other, as they both measure screen resolution.\n",
        "   - Similarly, `sc_h` and `sc_w` measure the physical dimensions of the screen, and their relationship may also impact the overall device pricing.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring correlations between the numerical features and the target variable `price_range` could help identify the most important predictors for mobile phone pricing.\n",
        "- **Modeling**: The data is now ready for building machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests) to predict the `price_range` based on the features.\n",
        "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization techniques like histograms, boxplots, and pair plots can provide additional insights into the distribution of numerical features and their relationships."

Label encoding is efficient for variables where the categories have a meaningful order (e.g., low, medium, high), making it suitable for models that can understand the rank but not the actual categorical labels.\n",

        "- **Label Encoding**: Useful for ordinal data with a natural ranking to simplify and maintain the order in the model without creating excessive dimensions.\n",

        "Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, in this project, we have constructed a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict mobile prices ranges after dividing our dataset into train and test sets. Then, we have trained the model and tried to evaluate with some performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Further, we used the techniques like **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning**; examples: **GridSearchCV**, **RandomizedSearchCV** and **Bayesian Optimization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Findings and Conclusions are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Performances of Initial Model:**\n",
        "   - Random Forest was fairly good, and the model had a fairly good accuracy measure on the test.\n",
        "   - Despite this, the improvement needed was in balancing precision and recall among different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cross-Validation**:\n",
        "   - We have applied 5-fold cross-validation in order to prevent overfitting and have ensured that the model is evaluated on different subsets of data and not on just one subset where it was trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
        "   We used **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for finding the best possible set of hyperparameters such as no. of estimators, max tree depth, and minimum samples required to be considered for splits.\n",
        "   Other type of optimization which we used includes **Bayesian Optimization**, it finds out its way through the hyperparameter space with minimal evaluations, so this too is possible for huge-size data and complex models as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Model Performance**:\n",
        "- Tunes hyperparameters and actually got a better accuracy, showing that a good set of parameters provides better predictions.\n",
        "    - Model at the end achieved an even distribution of precision, recall, and F1 score for each class, and hence false positive and false negatives were reduced.\n",
        "- The **confusion matrix** and **classification report** give a good overview of how well the model is working across all classes.\n",
        "- The **ROC curve** and **AUC score** indicate that it really does a great job of separating the classes, even in lots of binary classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "-\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hyperparameter tuning** significantly increases the performance of the models since the most ideal configuration for the algorithm can be used.\n",
        "The critical step in the above process is checking that model so it may generalize well to unseen data and does not overfit the training set. The robust classifier that can deal with both numerical and categorical data very effectively and is resistant to overfitting due to its nature of being an ensemble is the **Random Forest.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a word, such pairs, namely, strong algorithms and more careful hyperparameter optimization, may result in rather effective and reasonably goodperforming models which are suitable for a really very wide range of classification problems."
